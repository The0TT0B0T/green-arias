 customer-landscaping-store
this website is a work in progress but is commissioned by a customer. so will be finalzied once i figure out the backend part with node.js


What this website is supposed to do is kinda an ecommerce store but without actually selling anything. The customer wants to place this site on ads and have them fill out their information with the services they need, so 
he can go out there and give them an estimate on the cost. That way he can reach more people in a shorter time and hopefully expand the buinseness. The customer also  wants the information the clients provide once they process their order to recieve a text message when he will arrive and what services they wanted. It will also send himself the information so my client knows what clients need to be scheduled in.
